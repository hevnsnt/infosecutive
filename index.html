          <h2>Why SMBs Can’t Ignore Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>Is your business ready if a hacker strikes?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row content" data-aos="fade-up">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>
              Today, hackers are increasingly targeting small and mid-sized businesses, especially those without a dedicated IT or security team. These attacks often happen quietly and without warning, leaving business owners unaware until the damage is done. 
              Unfortunately, 60% of companies that suffer a cyber incident shut down within six months. Unfortunately, Hackers treat small businesses as low-hanging fruit: easy to compromise, profitable, and less likely to have the tools to defend themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The financial hit is devastating.</b> Imagine waking up to find your systems locked and having to inform your customer that the data they trusted you with has been posted publicly on the dark web. A single cyber incident can drain your cash reserves, 
              destroy the trust you’ve built, and send loyal clients elsewhere. For small businesses, the average cost to recover from an attack ranges from $120,000 to over $1.2 million. Can your business afford this?
            </p>
            <p>
              As a recognized cybersecurity professional, I often meet clients only after they’ve been had a major cybersecurity incident. That is why I created this InfoSecutive Bootcamp. My aim is to offer you the same executive-level cybersecurity guidance that’s normally 
              reserved for large enterprises or highly profitable firms. In just four hours of focused, jargon-free training, you’ll gain clear, practical steps you can put into action immediately. You’ll walk away ready to safeguard your business, lead your team with confidence, 
              and turn cybersecurity into a genuine strategic advantage.

          This interactive workshop will demystify cybersecurity and give you executive-level control over your company’s cyber safety. We will begin by explaining 
          the current threat landscape in plain English – you’ll learn who the bad actors are and what they’re after. Then we’ll show you how criminals operate, tools they use, and then 
          how to spot and stop such attacks. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          We will guide you through the critical cybersecurity measures every small business must implement. You’ll receive clear instructions on how to engage your IT provider and verify they deliver the services you need. 
          Too often those protections are missing not out of negligence but simply because they were never explicitly requested. Our recommendations draw on official <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/manage-your-business/strengthen-your-cybersecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Administration</a>
          guidance and our own cybersecurity expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will join us for an in-depth walkthrough of a real cyber incident at a business just like yours. First we’ll explore how the attackers found their way in, then you’ll see the full impact on systems and data, and finally we’ll demonstrate 
          how a rapid, well-rehearsed response can turn a potentially crippling event into a manageable incident. Imagine having a clear, step-by-step plan the moment your laptop goes missing or ransomware locks down your network. That level of 
          confidence and clarity is exactly what this training delivers.

          By the end of the session, you will have a clear, prioritized follow-up list tailored to your business. You will know exactly which steps to tackle first and receive straight-forward advice on what to do if your IT provider cannot immediately answer your questions. We 
          will supply ready-to-use policy templates for your business, such as an IT use policy and an incident response plan, so you can put them into action right away. Throughout the training, you are encouraged to ask questions and share concerns so we can learn from each 
          other and build stronger defenses together.
        </p>
        <p> 
          You’ll leave with newfound confidence as a business leader in charge of the cybersecurity of your business. No longer will cyber threats feel like an overwhelming IT problem. You will understand the key points to discuss with your IT team or service providers and be equipped 
          to make informed decisions to protect your business’s future. Every attendee receives a Certificate of Completion, which you can use to demonstrate your commitment to security and potentially lower your cyber insurance premiums, along with a packet of resources 
          including step-by-step security checklists and contacts for follow-up support. More importantly, you’ll take away peace of mind, knowing that you have proactively taken steps to guard your company’s assets and reputation.

                Absolutely not. This workshop is built specifically for business leaders without a technical background. We break down every idea into clear, straightforward language and illustrate with real‑world examples. 
                You’ll walk away with a focused set of high‑impact tasks, ready‑to‑use policy templates, and step‑by‑step checklists, no coding or firewall configuration required. Just bring your leadership mindset and eagerness to take control of your company’s security.

              <p>
                By the end of the workshop you’ll confidently put a clear, prioritized security plan into action, complete with ready‐to‐use policy templates and checklists, so you know exactly which controls to deploy and when. 
                You’ll be equipped to lead your team through phishing simulations and tabletop exercises, and to hold your IT provider accountable using our vendor evaluation framework. You’ll also understand how to implement critical 
                safeguards like multi‐factor authentication, automated patch management, and secure, regularly tested backups. Finally, you’ll have a tested incident‐response playbook at your fingertips, so you can contain an attack quickly, 
                minimize downtime, and protect your business’s reputation and bottom line.

              <p>
                Absolutely. Even if you have an MSP or MSSP, this bootcamp is a must. We often find leaders assume their provider covers backups, patching, monitoring, and incident response, only to discover those services fall outside 
                of the contract. In this session you’ll learn how to audit your service agreement, which questions to ask, and the exact checklists to confirm which tasks are performed and which are not. By the end you will have full 
                clarity on your provider’s responsibilities and the confidence to hold them to the security standards your business requires.

                Yes. Every attendee departs with the Essential 10 security controls checklist to guide your next steps, editable policy templates you can adapt to your business, and printable awareness posters to keep your team alert 
                to common threats. You’ll also receive a Certificate of Completion that you can share with your insurance carrier to demonstrate proactive risk management and potentially lower your premiums. These core resources give 
                you the foundation and proof points you need to strengthen your cybersecurity immediately.

                For $899 per seat, the InfoSecutive Bootcamp offers four hours of expert‑level cybersecurity training led by Bill Swearingen. You will study real‑world case studies that reveal how hackers breach businesses like yours 
                and gain the exact, step‑by‑step process to prevent an attack from crippling your operations. Every participant also receives printed and digital training guides, practical checklists and ready‑to‑use templates that 
                let you put proven defenses in place immediately. This hands‑on instruction can protect your company from a costly breach and deliver a substantial return on your investment.

                As an added bonus, all participants will receive a <strong>three-hour retainer for Incident Commander Services</strong>, valid for one year after the course (a $1,200 value). If you face a security incident during that period, a SixCyber incident commander will assist you with assessing and prioritising the scope of the incident, 
                coordinate containment and remediation efforts with your team, advise on interactions with forensic experts, legal counsel and regulators, and help craft clear communications for employees, customers and stakeholders.

                After the bootcamp you can tap into SixCyber’s range of services built just for small and mid‑sized businesses. We start by scanning your online presence to find and fix weak spots in your website and network. Then we lock down your 
                computers and devices so only the right people can access them. We can set up simple decoy traps that alert you the moment someone tries to break in. Your team will receive hands‑on training and mock phishing tests so they know exactly 
                what to watch for. We’ll also help you create an up‑to‑date inventory of every system and device in your business, and put strong email filters in place to stop dangerous messages before they reach your staff. If you need even more 
                support, we can introduce you to trusted local security experts or point you toward government programs that offer additional resources.
