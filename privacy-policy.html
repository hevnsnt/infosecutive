<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: May 18, 2025</em></p>

<p>Welcome to SixCyber.com. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>SixCyber, LLC.</strong> (“<strong>SixCyber</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our website and services. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> If you sign up to receive our cybersecurity bootcamp updates or contact us via email, we collect personal information you provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, or company name. Providing this information is voluntary, and it will be used only for the purposes for which you provided it.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong> When you visit our site, we automatically collect certain data through cookies and analytics tools. This may include your IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, and the date/time of your visit. This data helps us understand how our site is used and improve our content and security.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To send you updates about our InfoSecutive Bootcamp or other training services you have requested, and to respond to your inquiries.</li>
  <li><strong>Website Improvement:</strong> To analyze site usage and performance (via analytics) so we can enhance user experience and content relevance.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> As a cybersecurity company, we may monitor and use data (like IP addresses or user agent strings) to protect our site and services from malicious activity and to maintain the integrity of our training platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, such as maintaining records or responding to lawful requests by authorities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies to collect the automatic data mentioned above. For example, we use Google Analytics to gather anonymous statistics about our website’s traffic and usage patterns. These cookies help us understand which pages are most popular, how users navigate the site, and if any errors occur. This information is only processed in aggregate form and is not used to identify you individually.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> When you first visit our site, you might (or might not) see a cookie notice. You can choose to accept all cookies or adjust your browser settings to refuse non-essential cookies. Most browsers also allow you to delete cookies or block them in the future. Note that if you disable cookies, some features of our site may not function as intended. By clicking “Accept” on our cookie banner, you consent to our use of cookies as described in this Policy.</p>

<h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share information in these limited situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf – for example, an email marketing service to send you bootcamp notices, or website analytics providers (like Google Analytics). These partners are contractually obligated to handle data in compliance with privacy laws and only for our specified purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law or valid legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SixCyber, our customers, or the public, we may disclose necessary information (for example, in response to a court order or regulatory inquiry).</li>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event that SixCyber undergoes a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, personal information may be transferred to the successor organization. If that happens, we will ensure the new owner is bound by terms protecting your data to at least the same standard and notify you of any choices you may have regarding your information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
<p><strong>GDPR (EU/UK) Rights:</strong> If you are located in the European Union, United Kingdom, or a similar jurisdiction, you have the right to access the personal data we hold about you and to request that we correct, update, or delete it. You can also object to or restrict our processing of your data, or request to receive your data in a portable format. When we process data based on your consent (for example, if you consented to receive our newsletter), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</p>
<p><strong>CCPA Rights:</strong> If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information we collect, how we use it, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it. You may request that we disclose the specific pieces of personal data we have about you, or that we delete your personal information (subject to certain exceptions under the CCPA). SixCyber does <em>not</em> sell your personal information, and we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.</p>
<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights:</strong> To exercise any of the rights above or ask a privacy-related question, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sixcyber.com">info@sixcyber.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity (for example, by confirming control of your email address) before fulfilling certain requests. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
<p>We take data security seriously. SixCyber implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include access controls, encryption of data where appropriate, secure hosting environments, and regular security assessments as part of our company’s mission. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes stated in this Policy or as required by law. For example, if you provide your email to receive bootcamp updates, we will retain it for that purpose until the bootcamp event is concluded or you opt-out, and thereafter only as needed for any follow-up or legal retention requirements.</p>

<h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>We are based in the United States. If you are accessing this site from outside the U.S., be aware that information you provide will be transferred to and processed in the United States (or other jurisdictions where our service providers may be located). We will handle all personal data from international visitors in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. When required, we rely on appropriate safeguards – such as Standard Contractual Clauses – to ensure that cross-border data transfers protect your privacy rights.</p>

<h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or relevant laws. If we make material changes, we will post a prominent notice on our website or notify you by email (if you have provided one) prior to the change becoming effective. The “Last updated” date at the top of this Policy indicates when the latest changes were made. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
