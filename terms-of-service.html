<h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p><em><strong>“As-Is” Provision:</strong></em> SixCyber provides the Site and all content on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While we endeavor to present accurate and up-to-date information, we make no warranty that the content is complete, error-free, or suitable for any particular purpose. <strong>Use of the Site is at your own risk.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, SixCyber’s cybersecurity training content, tips, and checklists are provided for educational purposes. However, we do not guarantee that by following our guidance your organization will be completely secure or free from cyber incidents. Cybersecurity is a complex and ever-changing field, and **SixCyber disclaims any warranties** (express or implied) that our information will meet your specific needs or expectations. This includes any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, all of which are expressly disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law [oai_citation:31‡aselfguru.com](https://aselfguru.com/website-legal-pages/#:~:text=A%20disclaimer%20page%20is%20critical,and%20suffers%20a%20negative%20outcome).</p>
<p>We also do not warrant that the Site will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors or viruses. While we implement security measures (it’s our specialty, after all), no website is 100% immune to vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, SixCyber, its directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Site or our services. This includes, without limitation, any damages for lost profits, lost data, business interruption, or other intangibles, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>Our total aggregate liability for any claim arising from your use of the Site or our training services is limited to the amount (if any) you have paid to us for those services in the past twelve months, or fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50) if you have not paid us for any service. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain liability exclusions or limitations, so parts of this section may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.</p>

<h2>7. External Links and Third-Party Content</h2>
<p>Our Site may include links to third-party websites or embed content (for example, an embedded video or a reference to an external cybersecurity resource). These links and contents are provided for convenience or reference only. SixCyber does not control and is not responsible for any third-party sites or content. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement by SixCyber. If you follow an external link, your use of those sites will be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

If we make material changes, we will notify users by posting the updated Terms on this page and updating the “Effective Date” above. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Site after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

<p>These Terms and any dispute arising from your use of the Site or our services will be governed by the laws of the State of Kansas and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any disputes shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Johnson County, Kansas, and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts.
